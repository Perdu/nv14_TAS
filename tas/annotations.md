It's possible to do a cj on the bb in the beginning. It's slightly faster, but we don't have a good angle to land and start the rcj

I changed route over the MBD: at the top of the level, I do a stumble instead of a cj, then I jump directly on the wall of the switch instead of stumbling. This saves some time, but makes it difficult to get a good angle. I still manage to save 5f overall

The angle to land on the slope is extremly tight and we need to jump sufficiently long during the cj to land it. There is some angle for which that works with a stumble instead of a cj up there, but it ends up not being faster as the cj makes us hit the ceiling and fall faster.

Branch 9: 1f earlier to the switch wall jump, but can't make anything out of it

I copied the inputs of the RTA run for the beginning (up to the doorkey) because I find a better or even tying route

# 01-3

I tried:
- many ways to turn around in the beginning. The RTA jump does not seem faster.
- to take the second switch on the way down, getting pushed from the ceiling or not. It's slower
- not slowing down on the slope to the third switch. Slower because you can't turn around fast.

Not getting stumped on the corner on the way down as fast.
The RTA path of jumping at the beginning of the slope is slower. Best is to jump where I jump, or afterwards.

Left-jump for the end is equally fast (but not in terms of subpixels)

# 01-4

Can't start turning right on 177 because the drone kills us
Jumping one frame earlier in 202 make us stumble on the platform on the right, which only allows for slower later paths
Can't get a better angle on jump back up (751) because one less jump frame gets a stumble

I tried many different routing for the way back up.
I don't know if current routing is the absolute best, because the slope stumbles make many routes not work in practice. It's pretty hard to find a route that is both working with jumps working up to the end and still optimal. But given the very good angle and the double jump I get on the very first jump, I have pretty good confidence in this one.

For other (slower) route with more double jumps, watch this out:

Jumping faster on the bounceblock and the first platform eventually slows us down

Not doing a corner jump to be able to go to the door directly is a tie. I tried all possible strategies inbetween there. I kept the most stylish one ;)

Didn't work:
- doing reverse corner jumps between blocks in the middle section (angle are not good for the whole column)

# 02-1
rerecords: 1258

Jumping twice on the wall left or the wall right around 500 is not faster

Jumping to get down before the doorswitch does not save any frame, it's just for style

# 02-2
rerecords: 719

I tried doing a corner jump on the thwump to jump-start the jumps but it didn't work

The frame-perfect chimney jump does not save any frame over rta.
I just saved one frame by entering the chimney with a slightly better angle

# 02-3

We have to lose one frame (not jumping around 560) to get a better angle for the jump over the last drone

# 02-4

Jumping to go down small paths does not save any frame, it's just for style

Stumbling near the end is faster

Calculating the best path to slow down and jump down tubes is a pain and may still be improvable

It might be able to crame 1 or 2 additional frames, but it's hell to optimize

Beginning is so tight and frame-perfect that I can only copy 0th and not gain any millimeter

The only gain is on the jump over the doorswitch

# 03-2

Straight jump from the top platform (no corner jump): slower

Somehow I can't reproduce the RTA jump... It's faster, but I can't reproduce it while fixing the beginning

That said, even if I reach the doorswitch faster, I struggle doing a score as good as the current TAS

# 03-3
rerecords: 2273

Can't beat the drone in the beginning (except if jumping, but it's then slower)
Going after the drone without jumping on the wall in the beginning is a bit slower (reaching platform on frame 273 instead of 267)
Jumping on the left wall around 320 to get detected by the drone -> slower

Jumping right directly around 780 is half a frame faster than the classic right - left - right

Around 1050, the earlier we slow down the better

I also tried some tricks for the hs TAS:
- going left in the beginning to double-jump in the middle: slower, even if we get detected by the drone
- not jumping around 600: slower

Perhaps going to the right in the outer section could avoid because slower by drone 4 (todo)

# 03-4
rerecords: 730

Jumping longer or shorter around 100 is slower (or not faster for longer jumps)

It's hard to understand how much the timing of the jump influence the last turnaround.
Anyway, by random tries, this is the fastest I went to the door, which is *half* a frame faster than rta (which doesn't save a frame)

Additional notes after further optimisation:

Couldn't save an additional frame on either the top section or the bottom section.

The bottom section is 0.18 px away from being able walljump one frame earlier and save an additional frame.
The top section 0.05 px away from entering the exit an additional frame earlier.

In the beginning, there doesn't appear to be a way to get in the ceiling hole with a walljump without using the thwump
Waiting for the jump out of the ceiling hole is faster than stumbling out
We wait for a few frames on the thwump to get higher. Waiting for longer gets lower.
The stumble down is the fastest way
In the end, being pushed right by the ceiling then doing a regular jump instead of a reverse corner jump is just sliiiightly too slow to get the door on the next frame

# 04-1
rerecords: 1850

Corner jump on the bounceblock on the way down: useless, you have to slow down a lot for it
In the end, we're going *too fast* and need to slow down or we meet the thwump (if going right directly)

Branch 8: thwump cj at the top
Branch 9: alt route

# 04-2

With the right angle, you can jump on the top thwump. This is absolutely completely useless as it speeds you downwards

# 04-3

I initially had a slightly better way past the drone after the switch (2 pixels), which I had to redo because of earlier drone detection. But it doesn't actually lose a frame on the way to the pipe up, and we're actually faster there. We avoid jumping in the corridor as the better positioning gives us too much speed in the pipe and kills us.

# 04-4
rerecords: 1579

Reused the beginning from Raif et al
Not getting the stumble around 210 is not faster
We can't go back directly in the hole in a single jump because the turret kills us if we stay in the air too long. iirc there were some paths that did work but were much slower.
Corner jump on the slope around 320 does not prevent the turret from killing us
We can't get a better angle than the one we get. We can press left to get a better angle towards the next slope, but we then can't jump directly into the switch hole (it's either too far away, or the drone stops us).
We have to slow down a little bit after the doorswitch, otherwise the drone is in a position that prevents us from doing the last jump directly to the door

# 05-0
rerecords: 3002

No or single walljump left for the first switch is not faster
I tried going backwards to do a double rcj on the single-block wall but couldn't make it work (and wasn't sure this would lead to anything anyway)

We wait to release the lower drone, but not the upper one. This is frame-perfect.

It does not seem possible to go between the last drone and the slope in the very end

Potential tile bwj to do in the lower section. Not sure it would actually save time as we wait for a drone later on

# 05-1
rerecords: 1695

In the beginning, we can get a bit of advance over 0th by corner jumping on the 3rd bit, but then we cannot reproduce the second corner jump with gain much more time
I had to copy the exact path of the 0th

Jumping left around 490 isn't faster
You can do a reverse corner jump around 595, and jump on the whole on the left... But there's no way you beat the thwump

Using the pipe in the end is faster than turning around (by about 10f)

Further optimisation:
1f saved from extra ck on bottom section
10f saved from faster method of getting past thwump
1f saved from jumping left before going to the second thwump
2f saved from cks across the top section

We can take the doorswitch without falling down (there's a 1-frame moment where we can jump), but it's useless as there's a drone that get in the way to get right directly.
We cannot get a cj on the thwump protecting the doorswitch.
We cannot beat the drone after the second switch (going directly up)

Turning around at the first doorswitch then activating the thwump and getting the key is few frames slower
Entering the key section after going all the way to the left wall and then waiting for the thwump is also a few frames slower

# 05-4

The turnaround to reach the switch is painful to optimize.
0th does a jump that's slower but does not stumble on landing. Current solution is slightly better.
Counter-intuitively, holding the wall for 1 frame *speed us down* a little bit

I tried many strategies in the end:
- 0th strategy (jumping on the left wall) is much slower
- trying to reach the wall up directly after the rcj... doesn't seem possible
- many angle for the rcj
- being pushed left by the small ceiling before the rcj
- getting less height on the right wall to be able to go directly up

With our faster beginning, we get seen by the drone and have to find a strategy to get out of the bb faster.
To get out of the central place, jumping directly right is not faster, neither is landing and jumping
Can't make a corner jump for the last big jump

# 06-2

If we land directly after the first switch, we die. We need to stumble.

It seems the best turnaround on 572 is to single-frame jump

For the last long jump to get to the door, corner jumping on the lower platform is exactly 1f slower (0.07 subpixels lol)

That double thwump cj is incredibly frame-perfect and hard to find. Hopefully I don't have to redo it because of earlier optimization

It's possible to save 1f in the beginning with 2 jumps (1 small then 1 mid), but this requires doing the 3 thwump cj again and they're a pain to pull off correctly

# 07-0
rerecords: 467

I tried:
- landing before starting the "pipe" jumps -> slower
- starting the pipe jumps earlier -> I can't do the additional jump on the block, I have to wait *that* much, which also means waiting for the drone to go
- cj on the bb: it works but is slower than current rcj solution
- jumping directly from first switch to second one: it is just barely not enough. There is one situation in which we can manage to be high enough to do a cj, but it's much slower

# 07-1

cj on last bb is not faster

# 07-2

We can jump one frame earlier in the beginning, but then we don't get good enough angles

Adding another jump on the slope of the way up from the bowl is not faster because the bb on the way down slows us down

Not jumping in the end is not faster

# 08-0

If very precisely timed, we can make a second jump on a bb on the left - but it's useless
The second jump we make on the way up makes us land later, but more to the right. It's better to get detected by the drone earlier!

The last jump to go down is extremlely tight. RTA seems to get a better angle for the stumble, which I can't reproduce (i'm not starting with the same speed)

# 08-1
rerecords: 820

In the beginning, landing the fall with a cj on the bb is slower
It's extremely annoying to find a turnaround strategy around the switch that doesn't get us killed. This solution works. There may be better ones.
cj on the bb on the way up does not allow us to jump straight into the hole on the left
jump from the bb does not allow us to jump straight into the hole on the left

It's possible to do a 5-jump pipe jump in the end, but we need to slow down considerably to pull it off, and it ends up being slower.

# 08-2

It's possible to do a rj then a rcj on the spiky platform on the left, then another one on the second spiky platform on the left, but it's completely useless

I tried different strategies for the beginning. This one seems to be the best at doing a double jump as fast as possible.

Perhaps slowing down the beginning could save time by not having to jump over the drone later
But then I don't beat the drone on the way down to the switch, which saves 17f

With any better angle to jump over the drone to get to the switch, the drone sees us and blocks us.

Triple jump around 550: doesn't lead anywhere

For the end, instead of using the launchpad, I initially did a rcj then jumped on the bb, then a cj to reach to door. The launchpad is 16 frames faster

# 08-3
rerecords: 3331

That skip took me 4-5 hours to pull off.

It's extremely tight and I only found one input sequence in which I used all possible time saves to make it work.

With a very precise input sequence, it's possible to slow down, jump from the starting slope, then jump over the mine. It's useless and does not actually save time (or perhaps it could be possible to find a slightly faster route)

On the way up, the double jump is faster than jumping directly from the last jump

There are many possible angles on the way up to push us left and land. In fact, we can be pushed left *a lot*, but being able to land faster is more useful.

Jumping on the left slope instead of doing a turnaround is slower.

# 08-4

On the way from the upper right switch to the doorswitch, cj + cj on the first bb is slightly faster than cj on the 2nd bb. In this path, you sadly can't go directly down without touching the platform on the left 

Slowing down right to slow down on the wall in order not to crash on the way to the switch is slower.

cj on the way up from the switch -> can't get to the lp directly
slope jump on the way up from the switch -> slower

We're very very close (0.12 pixels) from saving 1f of jump press to reach the doorswitch (if we jump 1f earlier).

I'm not entirely sure the used strategy of maximizing jumps on the way up is actually faster than rta strategy of slowing down to enter the pipe properly

In the end, we can't do a proper corner push to go down to the door because in all cases, we explode on the ceiling. But even if we slow down by removing 2 walljumps, the corner push does not land on the door and it thus slower.

# 09-2

1f rcj on the first switch doesn't go far enough, and longer rcj get the missile. We have to jump that long unfortunately

The lpwj at the beginning + cj saves us a whooping 3f over jumping on the wall and jumping from the platform normally

An actual backwards wall jump would be incredible, but I can't pull it off (you probably need more speed)

We can't get a better diagonal lp jump by slowing right before landing, except for the one the crashes us on the ceiling.

- try to cj on the bb: it's possible but then it doesn't go anywhere (branch 8)

Optimizing the jump over the top without getting zapped is tedious. This weird stumble on the way from the left to the right is better than another example I got

# 12-3

Level is maxed, can only improve subpixel

It *might* be possible to save 1f as I randomly saved 1 pixel, but I'm going a bit blind here

# 12-4
rerecords: 462

You can jump 1f less for the first switch, which lets you land further to the right, but doesn't allow you to jump earlier

The rcj is really tight and finding a better way to land on the platform is difficult (even getting another one that does is)

# 13-0

# 13-1
rerecords: 684

We *can* save time on the way down with a stumble. However, if we arrive too early, the drone chases us on the left instead of up and gets in the way. We *need* to be slow for that.
There may be an optimization to do to find a better beginning

We can get pushed when entering the doorswitch room to jump on the opposite wall 1f earlier. But it's a bit sower overall as we get less height.

On the way up to the door, getting wallpushed slows us down (lower height)
On the way up to the door, we can do a full jump, then wall jump and slope jump on the way to the lp, but it's slightly slower.

Jumping over the drone seems to be faster than waiting for it, as the higher jump gives us more speed for the bump rj. Not entirely sure if there could be a faster path waiting for the drone.

Can't find a path with a jump first that saves time

A second thwump cj on the way left crushes you against the wall (branch 9)

Thwump cj on the most-left thwump on the way back: useless (branch 7)

Thwump cj on the way back on the second row of thwumps : slower, we can't immediately land on the upper section after a single wj (branch 6)

Walljump after the switch is faster than turnaround

Can't seem to do a bwj on the trapdoor, which would be faster is possible

Branch 7: on the way down, use two stumbles instead of catching the wall

I have to jump that high to the exit switch, otherwise I don't land right enough to slow down on the wall

# 18-4
rerecords: 853

I tried rcj and cj in the very beginning but there's no interesting path

Quad on the lower left bounceblock followed by jumps on two bbs above gets you to the top faster than rta, but is slower across the top because you can't get a good bbcj

Branch 9: I tried optimizing the beginning, but it turned out to be slower than 0th

# 19-0

# 19-4
rerecords: 453

Didn't work:
- in the beginning, jumping right from before the launchpad to reach the platform: it's very tightly too short (the ceiling pushes us down)
- in the first square, going down from the middle section, then using the launchpad to try to get to the second square from the bottom (works, but slower: we have to make a walljump to get to the switch) or the right (slower)
- Crazily, if we get to the launchpad from the right side of the first square, on a very specific angle, we can get to the bottom side of the second square thanks to a stumble; but that ends up slower as well (I made a video)
- reverse slope jump on the first square after the launchpad does not allow to get back to the 2nd square easily. Corner jump there isn't useful. Right - left - right jump gets too high. In fact, timed correctly, it gets exactly too short to land on the left side of the second square (it reaches the corner!)
- getting a corner jump when landing on the third square: faster to reach the switch but you can't get pushed back to reach the lp faster

Somehow, the stumble on the middle rectangle make us gain 1 frame when reaching the launchpad on the left. We get faster to the third square because of the exact angle of the bounceblock jump: the ceiling pushes us slightly downwards.

Stumble in the end is faster with subpixel optimization

Doesn't work:
- starting on the left slope
- going to the left and double-jumping on the thwump (gets electrocuted afterwards)	
- any double jumps on the thwump in the beginning doesn't lead us anywhere
- corner jump at the top to pass the last thwump

Sadly I have to jump a bit higher to wait to be able to avoid the top thwump. I tried going left of it but can't beat it (it pushes me on the middle platform, slowing the descent).

I got one demo in which the last corner jump did not hit the thwump and I could jump on the other thwump (see demo below). I don't think this would really be faster but I can't reproduce it with the faster beginning now.

Somehow, not delaying the jump at 467 was always faster. Current solution may not be the absolute best one.

Doing two proper bounce corner jump in the beginning gets us too fast: we end up hitting the drone on the left. I had to slow down a bit to be able to pass it

Double corner bounce on lower bb around 820: useless trajectory

Not sure if doing a double bounce block jump in the end like the rta run does would be faster. I don't think it would, and I could not reproduce a proper one a second time. I think current solution is faster anyway. It's slower in rta at least.

Thwump jump at start: not enough height, waiting for thwump to come up high enough wastes too much time

Couldn't beat drone even with improvement to the start

Entrance into upper section: cj to walljump off thwump was slower than current method. Could only get a small boost from the thwump.

Top right corner: Jumping to ceiling and turning around slower than corner shove

Launchpad/locked door key section: Wallsliding to the floor and doing a wj into the chimney was slower than current method of using the lp. Wallsliding to the floor then doing a turnaround back to the lp is also slower.

Double rcj after the bb doesn't leave a good angle for the next one.

Doing an rcj to enter the exit key section and collect it before the locked door key is slower.

There doesn't seem to be anyway to go over the laser drone on the way to the second locked door key. And doesn't seem to be any way to stop it from the second time either.

Running off the platform beneath the drone is slower than the current method of jumping.

Didn't test cj for going back through middle section as it would seems like it would need too much slowing down,

Rcj at the end couldn't get high enough to avoid the double wj.

To land, stumble + lower part of the slope after the mine is slower
Somehow the stumble at 417 is by one frame the fastest way
Around 650: reverse slope jump + left walljump: it's sooo bad

There are many different possibilities to test. For instance, we can hold right longer on the bb. This one seems optimal.

There's a branch in which we avoid the cj on the way up to the middle section, which is slightly faster, to go to the left, but we get a worse angle

Branch 9: alt route jumping lower on the way back to the middle section, the walljumping on the left. The way to the left is faster, but walljumps lose time.

Stopping the jump at 147 and left input at 139 is *too fast*: we can't get the thwump corner jump

I can't beat RTA. I need speed information to manage to optimize the beginning.

2 different tying strategies for the end

The slope jumps are a pain to optimize, there may still be room there

Branches 8 and 9: alt routes on the way down, same score (jump directly to the door, jump a bit further)

Cornerjump on the third square on the right -> slower to reach the doorswitch by 13 frames

Can't get pushed down on the square at 205 because we can't turn left without landing on the lower square

Can't beat rta, nor improve it

For the 4 cj route replacing the second cj with a wj seemed to be equal or slower

Triple jump in the beginning doesn't lead anywhere useful
Same for direct jump on wall

# 70-4
rerecords: 313

Turns out I can get 2 pixels on the way down by hitting the ceiling on this exact spot
Optimization of the path on the way down saves the remaining pixels, up to our last frame
Best strategy is actually not to avoid the last bb, but to catch it as early as possible so it gets pushed to the left

Jumping earlier around 238 does not allow to save a frame over rta. The jump is slightly lower, but not enough to save a frame

Can't find a path that gets a good corner jump around 210 without slowing a lot
Can't get a corner jump around 160
Can't get above the mine around 430 directly after the first land. Manage to do it once after a jump (don't remember which) but it was slower and now I can't reproduce it

Jumping at the start then falling, and wallsliding on side of bb to slow down all turned out to not be as good as the current method.

Doing an amazing series of jumps on bounceblocks using corners on the way up, we get so much speed that we crash on the ceiling :(

Corner jump on the top bounce on the right (the one in the middle) gives us an angle a little bit too low, we hit the edge and stumble way too much

First tased level, the intro was still done manually

Not faster:
- Starting on the left in the beginning
- Corner jump in the end

Did not work:
- use the small portion of the slope next to the mines to land on the previous-to-last row. It's possible on the second row (but slower), but somehow I can't get it to work on the other one, because the drone restrict possible trajectories

Doing a rj right of the doorswitch is slower. A wall jump as well
A wall jump after going over the switch is slower as well

For the first locked door swith jumping on the right then jumping on the left was slower

When falling from the top section jumping was overall slower

For the third locked door key jumping on the lower slope was slower

I tried many different strategies for this one. The optimal one seems to be to maximize the number of corner jumps, as long as they don't require pressing opposite directions *too much*. This is why we avoid some of them, and notably the last one, which is too slow.

I tried jumping directly on the first bb on the left by it was slower due to having to press opposite direction

We're 0.18 pixels away from saving 1f. We can't make the third pipe jump earlier as all possible angles lead to an unclean landing

I can't land a proper cj on the way to the switch that's actually faster
