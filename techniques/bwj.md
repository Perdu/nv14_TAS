Open map editor, place the ninja in the position you think would work.

Edit ninja position in the level string (after `5^`). Replace the demo string with `#99:192`. Be careful about empty lines in the end, otherwise the game won't jump.

Some quotes of Raif explaining the process:
> place the ninja is different positions and try jumping the second frame
> and then without jumping check the coordinates by exiting playback

> I change inputs then skip to the frame where the bwj would happen, and check coords to see how close I am then alter according
> Also watch the y-speed because if it decreases below the usual value it means you've hit the corner and the bwj will (in most cases) be impossible"

> my process was
> - put as much right input as possible until you hit the corner just barely
> - remove a right input until you just miss the corner
> a bit of a systematic way to get as close to the wall as possible
